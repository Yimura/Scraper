## Why use this package?

This is a YouTube scraper with zero dependencies.
Everything has been coded to have a minimal footprint creating a small package that's aimed at being as fast as possible.

### Timings

These are the timings I would get on average over 20 tests, ofcourse the Fetch time depends on how good your connection is to YouTube and how loaded YouTube is at that point.

| Type | Fetch Time | Processing Time |
|---|---|---|
| `video` | 585.632055 ms | 3.117175 ms |
| `channel` | 494.026065 ms | `not tested` |
| `playlist` | 569.424545 ms | `not tested` |

## Options

| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| language | `en` | Set the language that you would like for results to be returned in. A list of supported language types can be found [here](http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry). |
| searchType | `video` | Which type to search for on YouTube, supported types are `any`, `channel`, `live`, `movie`, `playlist` and `video` |
```
"Sort by" has not been implemented as of now.
All data is sorted in the default order that YouTube returns these in.
```

### Example Options
You can set the global language which YouTube should return results in or set the return language per search/request:
```js
import youtube from '@yimura/scraper'

// This will set the language to French from France globally
const yt = new youtube.default('fr-FR');

// Sets the language communicated to YouTube to Dutch from Belgium for this search
const results = yt.search('Never gonna give you up', {
    language: 'nl-BE',
    searchType: 'video' // video is the default search type
});
```

## Example Code

**CommonJS:**
```js
const Scraper = require('@yimura/scraper').default;

const youtube = new Scraper();

youtube.search('Never gonna give you up').then(results => {
    console.log(results.videos[0]);
});
```

**ESModule:**
```js
import youtube from '@yimura/scraper'

const yt = new youtube.default();
yt.search('Never gonna give you up').then(results => {
    console.log(results.videos[0]);
});
```

    channel: {
        name: 'Official Rick Astley',
